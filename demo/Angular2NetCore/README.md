## ASP.NET Core application with Angular 2 and Webpack
This is an example application of how to use [Angular 2](https://angular.io/) in an ASP.NET Core web application with [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/). It's a full feature isomorphic application that is composed only from Angular components that are rendered both server and client side on the same way. This application is the result we get once we execute the corresponding [Yeoman generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-aspnetcore-spa) and the original code lives in the [JavaScript Services](https://github.com/aspnet/JavaScriptServices) project in Github.
